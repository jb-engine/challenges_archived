# Manatal Code Challenges

This repository houses Manatal's interviewing code challenges. These are small hands-on
projects that are relevant to the tasks you will be working on at Manatal.

## Ground Rules

* We prefer well-thought-out solutions over the quick-and-dirty kind. So take your time,
  if you need it. A rushed job is usually matched by a swift rejection.


## Challenges

Pick the one that most suites the position you wish to apply:

### Team Backend

* [Python challenge](python/)
* [Django challenge](django/)

### Team Frontend

* [Vue.js challenge](vue/)


## Free Style Challenge

If you feel that none of the challenges are sufficient to demonstrate your coding ability,
you can also choose to submit any project of your own choosing that you are most proud of.
